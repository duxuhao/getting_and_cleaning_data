# getting_and_cleaning_data
Assignment submission for getting and cleaning data course

This repo is to create a tidy data that can be used for latter analysis. THe original data is available on the website
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
THe data, which is contain the activity information of our human body, is collected by the Samsung smartphone.

##The file in this repo
*README.md -- the description of the repo and the scripts.
*CodeBook.md -- decribing the variable, data and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
*run_analysis.R -- the code that I used to combine the data
*folder: test, train, file: README.txt, features.txt, feature_info.txt, activity_labels.txt is the file you get after unzip the data folder.

##The goal to achieve
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
